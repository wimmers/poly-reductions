# Polynomial-Time Reductions in Isabelle/HOL
This repository sets out to formalize some classic results about NP-completeness in Isabelle/HOL. 

## Using

The theories in this repository are developed with [Isabelle2021](https://isabelle.in.tum.de)

For checking and browsing the theories following sessions are needed:

- from the AFP: `Landau_Symbols`, `Verified_SAT_Based_AI_Planning`, `Graph_Theory`
- from [here](https://github.com/maxhaslbeck/NREST): `NREST`

Download those sessions and follow [AFP's Using Guide](https://www.isa-afp.org/using.html) to make them available for your Isabelle setup.

In the root folder of this repository invoke `isabelle build -D .` to check all the sessions.

For browsing the theories we recommend `isabelle jedit -l HOL-Analysis Poly_Reductions.thy &`. 
The first startup will pre-build `HOL-Analysis`---which will take a while. All following invokations of Isabelle/JEdit will be quick.

If you want to look only at Karp's Reductions: `isabelle jedit -l HOL-Analysis Karp21/All_Reductions_Poly.thy &`. 
If you want to look only at Cook Levin's Theorem: `isabelle jedit -l HOL-Analysis Cook_Levin/Complexity_classes/Cook_Levin.thy &`. 

## Overview
The following reductions are currently formalized:

## Work Plan
The current work plan is summarized [here](doc/PLAN.md) and tracked by Github issues and milestones.

## Index
### Polynomial-Time Reductions
So far the following classic reductions between NP-hard problems have been formalized:
- `Three_Sat_To_Set_Cover.thy`: 3CNF-SAT <= Independent Set <= Vertex Cover <= Set Cover 
- `CNF_SAT_To_Clique.thy`: 3CNF-SAT <= Clique
- `HC_To_UHC.thy`: Hamiltonian Cycle <= Undicrected Hamiltonian Cycle
- `VC_To_FNS.thy`: Vertex Cover <= Feedback Node Set
- `VC_To_HC.thy`: Vertex Cover <= Hamiltonian Cycle

### Auxiliaries
- `VC_Set_To_VC_List.thy`: The representation of `Vertex Cover` using list makes the reduction from `Vertex Cover` to
  `Hamiltonian Cycle` easier. The rest of the repository uses the representation with sets.
- `List_Auxiliaries.thy` contains a definition of a sublist used to describe paths.
- `Graph_Auxiliaries.thy` and `Graph_Auxiliaries.thy` contain some basic lemmas used at different places.
- `Vwalk_Cycle.thy` contains a new definition of a cycle in a graph based on `vwalk`.
   The standard definition is based on `awalk`. 

## NREST
For reasoning about the runtime complexity of the reductions, we use: https://github.com/maxhaslbeck/NREST.
